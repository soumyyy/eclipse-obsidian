Day 1: 04/06/25
Reached MAO at 10am, we rented scooters at a very subpar place for 420rs/day and went off towards Palolem towards our Airbnb stay. The stay was also mid one could say. We decided to go for a breakfast at German bakery, it was quite decent for the price.
we came back to the stay, got a lil ready and then headed towards finding a cliff jumping spot, at which we gailed after heavily trekking/hiking but finding an isolateed beach. and some good rocky structures to just chill.

We were then back to our stay, took a bath and planned going towards butterfly beach. And boy was is one hell of an experience. It was a 6-8km ride and as we reach there, we found it was an entirely off-roading experience, i started the activa alone, and soon after got my calf touched by the silencer, didnt mind the pain and kept going a lil forward. We reached the beach in about 10-15 mins more of crazy off-roading. the beach was 10-15 mins more of trek afetr we parked our activa, but boyy was it surreal, the whole place was prett secluded, and the vibes were immaculate. I refrained from going into the water because of the injury. Wer had couple of coronas and chilled for a while at the beach.

We were heading back to our stay but then asu's activa stopped working, because water went inside the silencer when we went through a puddle of water. Lush went ahead and called for some help, but by the time the guy came, we activa almost started, not to miss out the distance me and ashish had to drag the activa. Quite an experience.

Later that night we got beers and Cabo with pineapple juice. We had out dinner at this typical restaurant called Bhibhitaki and the food was quite spot on to say, we played some pool as well. Then the obvious we had good drinks and alcoholic chocolates which were again a treat man. nothign parallel to a boys night.

Day 2: 05/06/25
We woke up with good sleep and planned ot headed towards Palolem beach, therse two went first while I visited the doctor to get medicine and my burn checked out. THen we headed to one secluded side of palolem beach, for which we had to cover 3feet of water and man there was no one on the other side. just the three of us. grateful moment. Then we headed for a breakfast in a restro called the mill, again food was smackity smack. had my go to cold brew tonic.

Then that day we went towards Cabo de rama fort, which was like 24km from our stay in Palolem, it was quite some ride, we funnily tried exploring the exact place where the picture for Dil chahta hai was taken but we found that it was chapora fort. as we headed from the fort to the pebble beach down we had the most filling and comforting lemon soda ever, also the view was immaculate. Pebbel beach was decent with okayokay crowd. then out next stop was cape goa, which was again fairly interesting. we had peoples beer and safe to say had one of the most wholesome moment in the smoking area of the beach. I'd call it peak life.

Then was the time for Cola beach and the lagoon, again the way to it was weirdly off-road, sketchy at first but then we made our way to that absolutely scenic beach and view.

we did an god beautiful experience kayaking, it was actually kinda cool. and that was about it, as the sun set beautifully, and we enjoyed ourself with. it was time to head back to our stay. which was again 12km ish w a very beautiful route.  In our way we bought some drinks like that amazing Matheus rose and also some beers and chips. 

Got ready and headed towards the place we planned to have dinner which was again a mid experience, but okay we had a half decent time so not much to complain the coke in the glass bottle was def the highlight.

Then off to the stay again to get wine drunk and some beer. That night was really something I remember going to the beach with one beer and having the time of our life gazing stars like never before on the beach, I also remember pissing into the sea drunk and 10/10 recommend the experience. and then off we went sleeping in our rooms. again good sleep.

Day 3: 06/06/25
This was the day of the checkout from the stay at palolem and end of our south goa trip, more importantly this day we went 90km from south to north goa. But yea we again had out breakky at The Mill and then got ready and headed with all out luggage towards north goa, I'll cut the hassle we all went thru to decide if we should get a car instead of two wheeler because how crazy the travel was getting, but yeahh we decided we were gonna continue in the activa only because, money ofc. it was a loong 3.5-4hr ride with endless stops and ong the most scenic route I've been on, we reached Pappi chillo, booked us some comfort rooms and settled in. I remember the bartender making me a very special coffee based cocktail, which was spot on what I wanted. We got ready and headed towards thr
