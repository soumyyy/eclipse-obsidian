this is one of my friend Ashish is obviously from where to do family, but he likes keeping his expenses to minimum. Let's say 5000 the city of Mumbai and feels very guilt when he need to ask for extra money, he claims that he needs to do this because the struggle is necessary, but because of this, he is, he is missing on major experiences while living the best of his life, let's say even going for a concert, maybe, or maybe even putting money to learn up a new skill or even gym or any sport necessarily or he claims that he needs the struggling face.

I'm not about my process on these things so they should be. Should I be chasing this puzzles me

The hardest question I've had to ask myself was what should I be good at?
