Hi team, 
I've been following Fal with genuine excitement, the work around with low-latency API infra and speed up ML deployment especially interests me. I'd love to explore any opportunity to contribute in a **remote** capacity, whether as an **intern** or in any **hands-on technical role**.

I'm currently pursuing my **undergrad in Artificial Intelligence** and have built a strong foundation in core AI domains, including **diffusion models**, which I've applied in personal projects. I've previously worked in fast-paced Founder's office roles, contributing across **AI-driven features, frontend deployment** and** **UI/UX. Some of my key projects include:
1. **ECLIPSE** - a speech-to-speech AI assistant built using **GPT-2** and **BERT**.
2. **Hexalith** - a conversation image recognition chatbot using **YOLO** and fine-tuned **LLaMA**, which secured first place in college level hackathon.
3. **PhotoCortex** - a **computer vision** project focused on enhancing multi-object and facial tracking with scene understanding using custom-trained and fine-tuned models.

Here's a quick look at my work:** ****_Portfolio_**

Would love to hear from you if there's any space to collaborate, even short-term or trial-based.

Best, 
**Soumya Maheshwari**
